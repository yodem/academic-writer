# Academic Writer — OCR

OCR (optical character recognition) reads the text out of a scanned or photographed page. Transcribe a PDF, an image, or a folder of them with `aw ocr`. OCR copies the source text exactly: it never corrects, modernises or paraphrases it, because the text may later be quoted as evidence.

1. If the author gave no path, ask for the file or folder.
2. Choose the language: `he`, `en` or `mixed`. Take it from `.academic-helper/profile.md`, or ask when the source language is unclear.
3. Write the output under a project folder named `ocr-output/`, and run:

```bash
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/aw" --data-dir "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}" --project-dir "$PWD" ocr \
  --input <pdf|image|directory> --lang <he|en|mixed> --run <run-id> \
  --format concise --out <project-local-output.md>
```

- Add `--pages <range>` to process only some pages.
- Use `--format detailed` when the author wants notes on layout, footnotes and tables.
- For a folder, process one file at a time and write a separate output file for each document.

4. The command returns one record per page with whether the page already had digital text, a confidence level and notes. Report these faithfully: tell the author which pages were low-confidence, skipped or failed, so they know which pages to check against the original.
5. Never overwrite the source file.
